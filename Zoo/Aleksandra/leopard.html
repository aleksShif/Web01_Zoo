                <div class="animal-info">Leopards are one of the most adaptable big cats, found in a wide range of habitats including:

                    Savannas (Sub-Saharan Africa),
                    Rainforests (Congo Basin, Southeast Asia),
                    Mountains (Himalayas, Caucasus, Russian Far East),
                    Deserts and dry forests (Middle East, India),
                    and
                    urban edges.
                    Their adaptability allows them to survive in both extreme heat and cold, as long as there is sufficient prey and cover.</div>

                <div class="animal-info">Leopards are opportunistic carnivores, known for their stealth and strength, and they eat:

                    medium to large mammals (impalas, gazelles, deer, warthogs),
                    smaller prey (rodents, birds, monkeys, reptiles),
                    livestock,
                    and
                    carrion.
                    They are known for dragging their kills up trees to keep them safe from scavengers like lions and hyenas.</div>

                <div class="animal-info">Leopards are classified as Vulnerable, but their status varies by subspecies. Threats to leopards include:
                    habitat loss and fragmentation,
                    poaching and illegal wildlife trade,
                    retaliatory killings (by farmers when leopards prey on livestock),
                    and
                    competition with other predators such as lions and tigers.
                    Conservation efforts include: 
                    protected reserves and parks,
                    law enforcement,
                    and
                    breeding and reintroduction programs for critically endangered subspecies.
