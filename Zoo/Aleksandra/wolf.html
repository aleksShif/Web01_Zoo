Today, they are found in a reintroduced population in eastern North Carolina, particularly in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and surrounding areas.</div>

                <div class="animal-info">Red wolves are carnivores with a diet consisting mainly of:

                    small to medium-sized mammals,
                    white-tailed deer,
                    birds and reptiles.
                    Occasionally, they may scavenge or eat fruits and insects.
                    They are opportunistic hunters, using their keen senses and teamwork to hunt efficiently.

                <div class="animal-info">The red wolf is critically endangered, with fewer than 20 remaining in the wild as of recent estimates. Their decline is due to habitat loss, hunting, and hybridization with coyotes. Conservation efforts include:

                    captive breeding programs,
                    protected reserves,
                    public education and awareness campaigns,
                    and red wolf recovery programs.</div>
