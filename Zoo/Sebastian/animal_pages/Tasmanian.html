                        The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world, found exclusively on the island of Tasmania. It is known for its powerful jaws, which can crush bones, and its loud, eerie screeches, which gave it its devilish name. Tasmanian devils are scavengers, feeding primarily on carrion, but they will also hunt small animals. In recent years, the species has been threatened by a contagious facial tumor disease, which has drastically reduced their population. Conservation efforts are underway to save these unique marsupials from extinction.
