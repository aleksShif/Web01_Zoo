                        The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is a fascinating amphibian native to the lakes beneath Mexico City. Unlike most salamanders, axolotls retain their larval features throughout their lives, a phenomenon known as neoteny. They have feathery external gills, a wide, smiling mouth, and an extraordinary ability to regenerate limbs, spinal cords, and even parts of their hearts and brains. Due to habitat destruction and pollution, axolotls are critically endangered in the wild, though they are commonly kept in captivity and used in scientific research.
